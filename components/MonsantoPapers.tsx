        The Monsanto Papers: Evidence of Deception
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        During litigation, thousands of internal Monsanto documents were unsealed, revealing a decades-long pattern of
        cover-ups, ghostwritten studies, and efforts to suppress cancer research. These "Monsanto Papers" became crucial
        evidence in proving the company knew about Roundup's cancer risks and actively concealed them from the public.

        <p className="text-red-900 text-sm leading-relaxed">
          Internal emails, scientific studies, and strategic communications exposed a coordinated effort to:
          <strong> manufacture doubt about glyphosate's cancer risks, discredit independent scientists, and influence
          regulatory agencies.</strong> These documents were so damaging that juries awarded billions in punitive damages
          to punish Monsanto's "malice" and "oppression."

          <strong>Legal Significance:</strong> Judges allowed these documents as evidence of "malice, oppression, and fraud,"
          justifying punitive damages. Multiple juries concluded Monsanto <strong>knew or should have known</strong> about
          cancer risks and deliberately failed to warn consumers. This evidence was central to billion-dollar verdicts and
          Bayer's eventual settlement of over $15 billion.
