          <strong>These are real people who trusted the legal process.</strong> Every Roundup case is unique,
          and settlement amounts vary based on diagnosis, exposure history, and medical evidence. No attorney
          can guarantee specific results, but experienced mass tort lawyers know how to build strong cases and
          fight for maximum compensation. If you've been diagnosed with cancer after using Roundup, you deserve
          to have your story heard.
