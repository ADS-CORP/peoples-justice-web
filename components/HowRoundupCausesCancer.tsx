            <li>
              <strong>1. DNA Damage:</strong> Glyphosate causes breaks and mutations in your DNA, which can lead to cancer cells forming.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>2. Oxidative Stress:</strong> It creates harmful molecules called "free radicals" that damage cells and weaken your body's ability to repair itself.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>3. Hormone Disruption:</strong> Glyphosate interferes with your hormone system, which can trigger abnormal cell growth.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>4. Immune System Damage:</strong> It weakens your immune system's ability to find and destroy cancer cells before they spread.

            üí° Why This Matters for Your Case
          </h4>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-0">
            Monsanto knew about these cancer risks as early as the 1980s but hid the evidence from the public.
            Internal documents (the "Monsanto Papers") revealed the company ghostwrote research claiming Roundup
            was safe, attacked scientists who found harm, and worked with EPA officials to suppress cancer findings.
            This pattern of deception is why juries have awarded billions in punitive damages.
